# ts-apps-scripts

A build tool based on [Backpack](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/backpack) for backend and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for frontend.

Unlike these two project, `ts-apps-scripts` take a path to a "project" folder, this allow you to have multiple apps in a single NodeJS project (without using a monorepo).
